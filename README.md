# about_me

<p>
  Chuck drove my project while I navigated, we worked on adding some styling elements.
  I realize this should be in the pull request we worked on but that ship has sailed.
  I know why I was having issues with all of my projects now, I was missing the step
  to pull my changes from github down to my local master! All of my branches were
  starting at the beginning of the master line.
